# Storage Directory

This directory is used for runtime storage by FlexiAPI:

- `logs/` - Application logs
- `cache/` - General caching and rate limiting
- `sessions/` - Session storage (if needed)
- `temp/` - Temporary files
- `uploads/` - File uploads (if implemented)

All subdirectories are created automatically by the framework when needed.
